2D Sprite Animation
===================

Introduction
------------

In this tutorial, you'll learn two different ways to create 2D animated
characters. Typically, when you create or download an animated character, it
will come in one of two ways: as individual images or as a single spritesheet
containing all the animation's frames. Depending on which type of assets you
have, you can choose one of the following solutions.

First, we'll use :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>` to
animate a collection of individual images. Then, to use a spritesheet, we'll
use :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>` along with the _Animation_
property of :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>`.
