**Pull Requests should use the `master` branch by default.**

**Only make Pull Requests against other branches (e.g. `2.1` or `3.0`) if your changes only apply to that specific version of Godot.**

Things to keep in mind:

- [Godot docs writing guidelines](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/contributing/docs_writing_guidelines.html)
- [Godot pull request workflow](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/contributing/pr_workflow.html)
- If you need help with your PR, [#documentation on Discord](https://godotengine.org/community) is probably a good first starting point
- For large changes, it may make sense to discuss them in advance and maybe create an issue to let others know you're working on this
