Introduction
============

This tutorial series aims to illustrate intended Godot workflows, i.e. the
"best practices" of defining one's game API. Godot allows for a great 
amount of flexibility in how one designs a project's code and scene
structure. Each method will have its own advantages and disadvantages,
so outlining the best practices should help users feel less confused
as they further explore Godot's depth.

This series is also designed to help get users thinking about the best way
to reason about best practices. It would be impossible to give a comprehensive
overview of what one should do for any arbitrary design decision. As such,
each article breaks problems down into the fundamental questions they pose,
suggests the available solutions, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages
of each option, and then highlights the best course of action depending on the
circumstances.

While the articles in this series are largely topic-directed, it is
recommended that users begin with the "What are godot classes" article.
It is from there that the "best practices" for the rest of the engine
become more clear, based on established OOP practices.
