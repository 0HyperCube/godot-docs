List of classes and documenters
===============================

This page was a way class reference documenters would synchronize their work, but since we've moved the docs to github, it was decided that it would be better to move the list `to etherpad <https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/godotengine-list-of-classes-and-documenters>`_.

To use the list, you should simply pick a nickname (and maybe a color, though you can stay with the default color too) from the right sidebar, and follow the instructions there.
